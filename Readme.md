**Leetcode Problem 1512: Number of good pairs**
<br>Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.
A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

**Geeks for Geeks: Count Digits**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digits5716/1
<br>Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

Examples :
Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.

Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.
