**Leetcode Problem 1512: Number of good pairs**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/description/
<br>Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.
A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

**Geeks for Geeks: Count Digits**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digits5716/1
<br>Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

Examples :
Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.

Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.

**Leetcode Problem 1512: Number of good pairs**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/
<br>Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

**Leetcode Problem 9: Palindrome Number**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/
<br>Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints:

-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

**Approach :**
Negative Numbers: Any negative number is not a palindrome since the negative sign will not match in the reverse order.
Reverse the Number:
Reverse the digits of the number.
Compare the reversed number with the original number. If they are the same, then the number is a palindrome.
Efficient Check:
Instead of reversing the entire number, we can reverse half of the number and compare the two halves.

**Geeks for Geeks: LCM And GCD**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lcm-and-gcd4516/1
<br>Given two integers a and b, write a function lcmAndGcd() to compute their LCM and GCD. The function inputs two integers a and b and returns a list containing their LCM and GCD.

Examples:

Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: [10, 5]
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.
Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: [56, 2]
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.
Input: a = 1 , b = 1
Output: [1, 1]
Explanation: LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, while their GCD is 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= a, b <= 109
