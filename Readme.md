**Leetcode Problem 1512: Number of good pairs**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/description/
<br>Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.
<br>A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
<br>Output: 4
<br>Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
<br>Output: 6
<br>Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

<br>Example 3:
<br>Input: nums = [1,2,3]
<br>Output: 0

<br>Constraints:
<br>1 <= nums.length <= 100
<br>1 <= nums[i] <= 100

**Geeks for Geeks: Count Digits**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digits5716/1
<br>Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

<br>A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
<br>Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

<br>Examples :
<br>Input: n = 12
<br>Output: 2
<br>Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.

<br>Input: n = 2446
<br>Output: 1
<br>Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.

**Leetcode Problem 1512: Number of good pairs**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/
<br>Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

<br>Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: x = 123
<br>Output: 321

<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: x = -123
<br>Output: -321

<br>Example 3:
<br>Input: x = 120
<br>Output: 21

**Leetcode Problem 9: Palindrome Number**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/
<br>Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: x = 121
<br>Output: true
<br>Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: x = -121
<br>Output: false
<br>Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<br>Example 3:
<br>Input: x = 10
<br>Output: false
<br>Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<br>Constraints:
<br>-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

**Approach :**
Negative Numbers: Any negative number is not a palindrome since the negative sign will not match in the reverse order.
Reverse the Number:
Reverse the digits of the number.
Compare the reversed number with the original number. If they are the same, then the number is a palindrome.
Efficient Check:
Instead of reversing the entire number, we can reverse half of the number and compare the two halves.

**Geeks for Geeks: Frequencies of limited range array**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/frequency-of-array-elements-1587115620/0
<br>You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. These integers can be from 1 to p, and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers that lie in the range 1 to n.

Note:

Do modify the array in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i) and assume 1-based indexing.
The elements greater than n in the array can be ignored when counting.

Examples

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5], p = 5
Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 2 times. 3 occurring 2 times. 4 occurring 0 times. 5 occurring 1 time, all the modifications done in the same given arr[].

Input: n = 4, arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 3], p = 3
Output: [0, 0, 4, 0]
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 0 times. 3 occurring 4 times. 4 occurring 0 times.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [8, 9], p = 9
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element We have: 1 occurring 0 times. 2 occurring 0 times. Since here P=9, but there are no 9th Index present so can't count the value.

**Leetcode 1752: Check if array is Sorted and Rotated**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/
<br>Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

**Leetcode 26: Remove duplicates from Sorted array**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/
<br>Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 \* 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
