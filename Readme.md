**Geeks for Geeks: Count Digits**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digits5716/1
<br>Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

<br>A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
<br>Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

<br>Examples :
<br>Input: n = 12
<br>Output: 2
<br>Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.

<br>Input: n = 2446
<br>Output: 1

**Leetcode Problem 9: Palindrome Number**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/
<br>Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: x = 121
<br>Output: true
<br>Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: x = -121
<br>Output: false
<br>Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<br>Example 3:
<br>Input: x = 10
<br>Output: false
<br>Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<br>Constraints:
<br>-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

**Approach :**
Negative Numbers: Any negative number is not a palindrome since the negative sign will not match in the reverse order.
Reverse the Number:
Reverse the digits of the number.
Compare the reversed number with the original number. If they are the same, then the number is a palindrome.
Efficient Check:
Instead of reversing the entire number, we can reverse half of the number and compare the two halves.

**Leetcode 26: Remove duplicates from Sorted array**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/
<br>Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Coding Ninjas: Allocate Books**
<br>_link_ - https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/allocate-books_1090540?leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM
<br>Problem statement
Given an array âarrâ of integer numbers, âarr[i]â represents the number of pages in the âi-thâ book.

There are âmâ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.

Allocate books in such a way that:

1. Each student gets at least one book.

2. Each book should be allocated to only one student.

3. Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.

You have to allocate the book to âmâ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.

If the allocation of books is not possible, return -1.

Example:

Input: ânâ = 4 âmâ = 2

âarrâ = [12, 34, 67, 90]

Output: 113

Explanation: All possible ways to allocate the â4â books to '2' students are:

12 | 34, 67, 90 - the sum of all the pages of books allocated to student 1 is â12â, and student two is â34+ 67+ 90 = 191â, so the maximum is âmax(12, 191)= 191â.

12, 34 | 67, 90 - the sum of all the pages of books allocated to student 1 is â12+ 34 = 46â, and student two is â67+ 90 = 157â, so the maximum is âmax(46, 157)= 157â.

12, 34, 67 | 90 - the sum of all the pages of books allocated to student 1 is â12+ 34 +67 = 113â, and student two is â90â, so the maximum is âmax(113, 90)= 113â.

We are getting the minimum in the last case.

Hence answer is â113â.

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

Example 2:

Input: chars = ["a"]

Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]

**Leetcode 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/description/
<br>You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abbaca"

Output: "ca"

Explanation:
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move. The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

Example 2:

Input: s = "azxxzy"

Output: "ay"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105

s consists of lowercase English letters.
