**Geeks for Geeks: Count Digits**
<br>_link_ - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digits5716/1
<br>Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

<br>A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
<br>Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

<br>Examples :
<br>Input: n = 12
<br>Output: 2
<br>Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.

<br>Input: n = 2446
<br>Output: 1

**Leetcode Problem 9: Palindrome Number**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/
<br>Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: x = 121
<br>Output: true
<br>Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: x = -121
<br>Output: false
<br>Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<br>Example 3:
<br>Input: x = 10
<br>Output: false
<br>Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<br>Constraints:
<br>-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

**Approach :**
Negative Numbers: Any negative number is not a palindrome since the negative sign will not match in the reverse order.
Reverse the Number:
Reverse the digits of the number.
Compare the reversed number with the original number. If they are the same, then the number is a palindrome.
Efficient Check:
Instead of reversing the entire number, we can reverse half of the number and compare the two halves.

**Leetcode 26: Remove duplicates from Sorted array**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/
<br>Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**LeetCode 1009: Complement of Base 10 Integer**

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
Example 3:

Input: n = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.

**Intersection Of Two Sorted Arrays**
<br>_link_ - https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/intersection-of-2-arrays_1082149?source=youtube&campaign=love_babbar_codestudio1
<br>Problem statement

You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of size 'N' and 'M' respectively. Both these arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. You have to find the intersection of these two arrays.

Intersection of two arrays is an array that consists of all the common elements occurring in both arrays.

Note :

1. The length of each array is greater than zero.

2. Both the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. The output should be in the order of elements that occur in the original arrays.

4. If there is no intersection present then return an empty array.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

Constraints :

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= N, M <= 10^4

0 <= A[i] <= 10^5

0 <= B[i] <= 10^5

**LEETCODE 1: Two Sum**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/
<br>Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

-10^9 <= target <= 10^9

Only one valid answer exists.

**LEETCODE 75: Sort Colors**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/
<br>Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]

Output: [0,1,2]

Constraints:

n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 300

nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

**LEETCODE 15: 3Sum**
<br>_link_ - https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/
<br>Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]

Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Explanation:

nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.

nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.

nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.

The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]

Output: []

Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]

Output: [[0,0,0]]

Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 3000

-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
